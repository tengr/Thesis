\section{Data Collection} %Section - 1.1 
Our dataset is the Variome Corpus\cite{verspoor2013annotating}, which is openly accessible. \footnote{\href{http://www.opennicta.com.au/home/health/variome}\url{http://www.opennicta.com.au/home/health/variome}} \citet{verspoor2013annotating} gave a detailed illustration of the corpus construction process. I will summarize the main points here.
\subsection{Background}
The \emph{Human Variome Project}, or \emph{HVP}, the successor of the Human Genome Project, is a global initiative to collect all genetic variation information affecting human health\cite{ring2006human}. In particular, it acts as a liaison between individuals and organizations to integrate the genetic variants into databases that are open to the general public\cite{verspoor2013annotating}.\newline\newline
The \emph{International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours (InSiGHT)}, is an international organization which aims to benefit patients with hereditary gastrointestinal(GI) tumours by research, education and personal assistance. 



The corpus is Inspired by needs of inSIGHT database, but intended for broader applications Documents relevant to the genetics of Lynch syndrome, which covers inherited colon cancer as well as certain other cancers.Selected with PubMed Central To train tools for mining genetic variation and its relationship to disease
Here in this information extraction task, we treat the manually annotated data as the \emph{gold data},

the performance of the subgraph matching method, as an instance-based learning strategy (Alpaydin, 2004), is dependent on having good training examples that express the events in a range of syntactic structures, cite
