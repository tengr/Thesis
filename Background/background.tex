\section{Relation Extraction} %Section - 2.1 
In general, relation extraction refers two the process of discovering a relationship between entities in text. In the domain of natural language processing, the relation can be semantic, syntactic, etc, with semantic relations being the most important for knowledge discovery. Relations can be uniary, binary and complext with complex relations sometimes intermingled with the concept of events, In this project we are mainly concerned with binary relations as shown

\section{Named entity recognition}
\emph{Named Entity Recognition}, or NER, is the task of identifying elements in text that belong to pre-defined categories like person, organization, etc. Specifically, NER in biomedical text mining aims at identifying thing like proteins, diseases, genes, etc. There is extra difficulty for NER in the biomeidical domain mainly because of the following reasons.

This task has been challenging for several reasons. First, there does not exist a complete dictionary for most types of biological named entities, so simple text- matching algorithms do not suffice. In addition, the same word or phrase can

refer to a different thing depending upon context (eg ferritin can be a biological substance or a laboratory test). Conversely, many biological entities have several names (eg PTEN and MMAC1 refer the same gene). Biological entities may also have multi-word names (eg carotid artery), so the problem is additionally complicated by the need to determine name boundaries and resolve overlap of candidate names.
Because of the potential utility and complexity of the problem, NER has attracted the interest of many researchers, and there is a tremendous amount of published research in this topic. With the large amount of genomic information being generated by biomedical researchers, it should not be surprising that in the genomics era, much of the work in biomedical NER has focused on recognising gene and protein names in free text.
