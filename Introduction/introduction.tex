\section{Text Mining and Information Extraction} %Section - 1.1 


Text mining is a technology that uses methods in computer science, linguistics, and statistics to analysis natural language text and get the information within.  text mining transforms the large amount of unstructured data into structured format so that we have more data to analyze. Text mining is used widely in areas like marketing, document verifying, among others. Biomedical science has been developing quickly over the years, and the amount of published literature has risen to a point that is beyond manually analysis. Since there might be contradicting theories existing in those literatures, 	limited amount of reading might be causing to draw the wrong conclusions. A systematic way of analyzing documents is really necessary. The relation extraction tool has a very promising applications for researchers and medical field workers, pharmaceutical companies, 	and the general public.
