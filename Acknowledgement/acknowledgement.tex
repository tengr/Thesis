First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisor Prof. Karin Verspoor for the extremely helpful guidance and constant encouragement throughout the duration of this project. Her timely responses have really made this project work. In addition, my gratitude goes to Dr. Haibin Liu and Dr. Andrew MacKinlay for sharing valuable insights into the software system. I would also like to thank Dr. Jeremy Nicholson for chatting with me about NLP research. Finally I would like to thank my friends and family for carrying me through this extremely tough semester.
