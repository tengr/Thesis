Automatic information extraction from text has a variety of applications. Particularly, relation extraction from biomedical literature discovers the underlying structured information within biomedical literature and has inspired a significant interest in research. A variety of techniques, including pattern-based methods, co-occurrence based methods, feature-based methods, semi-supervised methods and kernel methods have been proposed and evaluated on different relation extraction tasks. In this project, we adapted an existing event-extraction system to a new corpus on relation extraction tasks.
