Automatic information extraction from text discovers the underlying, structured information  within unstructured text and has a wide variety of applications in this ``big data'' era. Particularly, relation extraction from biomedical literature can expand the biomedical knowledge base and has inspired a significant interest in research. A variety of techniques, including pattern-based methods, co-occurrence based methods, feature-based methods, semi-supervised methods and kernel methods have been proposed and evaluated on different relation extraction tasks. In this project, we adapted Approximate Subgraph Matching (ASM)\cite{liu2013approximate}, an existing event-extraction system to a new corpus --- the Variome Corpus \cite{verspoor2013annotating} for relation extraction tasks. We showed that merely changing the relation annotations to event annotations result in poor system performance. This is because fundamentally, trigger detection and prediction is an important process in event extraction, which however, is not included in relation extraction. Therefore, a full adaptation of the system is required to really explore the effectiveness of Approximate Subgraph Matching algorithms on relation extraction tasks.
